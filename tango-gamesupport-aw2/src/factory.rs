//! The Black Factory for human Black Hole armies and on design maps.
//!
//! The game's factory spawner (0x080607E8) deploys up to three units on the
//! row under the factory each turn, reading the unit types from a per-map
//! table (32 days x 3 slots) at the pointer in [`SPAWN_TABLE_PTR`]. Only the
//! AI's turn setup calls it (0x08061900, for a Black Hole army), and it takes
//! the table from the campaign map header, which design maps don't have: a
//! computer Black Hole there got garbage "units", and a human one got none.
//!
//! Two traps fix both, without touching the ROM file:
//! - after the AI setup stores the table pointer, design maps get Factory
//!   Blues' table (ground units, the campaign's schedule);
//! - in the start-of-turn code, a human Black Hole army's turn runs through
//!   the same spawner once, then carries on where it left off.
//!
//! Both run inside the emulated frame and keep their state in RAM, so
//! rollback and both netplay peers see the same thing.
