//! Dual Strike's battle animations for the seven new units, with the Dual
//! Strike pack: the units themselves and their effects (muzzle flashes,
//! missiles and shells, hits and explosions).
//!
//! AW2's battle scene keeps running the fight: backgrounds per terrain and
//! weather, the slide-in, HP counters and timing come from a *donor* AW2
//! unit's scene (Neotank for the Megatank, Rockets or Missiles for the
//! Piperunner, ...; [`donor`]). On a side showing a new unit the donor gets
//! one figure (Dual Strike shows these units as one, whatever their HP),
//! drawn from Dual Strike's own frames, animated by Dual Strike's scripts,
//! in the army's Dual Strike colours; the donor's effects on that side are
//! replaced by Dual Strike's. An Oozium has no weapon: it eats on the map
//! ([`crate::oozium`]), with no scene, as in Dual Strike.
//!
//! **Dual Strike's data** (the battle overlay, 2, loaded at `0x02350560`,
//! which draws everything with the 3D engine, a textured quad per piece;
//! the sheets and palettes in `battle/`):
//! - Unit records at `0x0236B1BC`, 0x50 bytes, by Dual Strike id - 1:
//!   words 1..5 are sprite sets (body, alternative body, primary weapon,
//!   secondary weapon, extra: ships' wakes), word 6 the palette table (five
//!   pointers to palette file names, one per army), word 7 the unit's scene
//!   numbers (from `+0xE`, five s16 (x, y) points: where its shots leave,
//!   from its origin), words 8 and 9 the muzzle flashes of the primary and
//!   secondary weapon (`{name, animation, flags}`), word 10 its projectile
//!   (five names, then the animation at `+0x14`), words 12..18 effects
//!   (`{name, animation}`): 12 its shots' hit, 14 an indirect shot's
//!   blast, 16 its own blast when destroyed (fire, splash or air burst).
//! - A sprite set: five sheet names (`char[4]`, one per army), five
//!   animation pointers, a word. An animation is `[frame table, script 0,
//!   script 1, ...]`.
//! - A frame: `u16 count`, then pieces of three u16 (as its drawing code,
//!   `0x023538C0`, reads them): x (9 bits, signed), flipped across (bit 10)
//!   and down (bit 11), width code (top 4: 0..3 for 8, 16, 32, 64 px); y (8
//!   bits, signed), height code (top 4); the texels' offset in the sheet in
//!   32-byte units (10 bits), depth (2 bits), palette half (top 4). A
//!   piece's texels are 4bpp rows, low nibble first (the sheets are 3D
//!   textures), drawn opaque (every piece's polygon has alpha 31, so the
//!   smoke is not blended). A frame pointer past the overlay's end is an
//!   empty frame (the blink of a destruction).
//! - A script: `(duration, frame)` byte pairs; frame `0xFC` is an event
//!   (`0x20`: a shot leaves; the Carrier's launches are `0x05`), `(0, 0xFD)`
//!   loops, `(0, 0xFE)` holds, `(0, 0xFF)` ends (the object disappears).
//! - Palettes: 64 bytes, two 16-colour halves; colour 0 transparent. The
//!   effects are neutral: every army's use `battle/119`.
//!
//! **Drawing.** Every frame of the scene, just before its VBlank copy of
//! the shadow OAM ([`OAM_COPY`], [`flush`]): the donor's figure sprites on
//! that side are dropped, and so are its effects (sprites from 512 on:
//! flipped ones are the left side's, the others the right side's; large
//! affine ones are explosions, the side's whose half they are in). The
//! unit's layers and its effects are composed at their current frames,
//! mirrored on the left (Dual Strike's art faces left), each half cropped
//! to its own (the scene's two windows both show sprites), cut into 8x8
//! tiles and covered with square sprites, one set per palette. The tiles go
//! in the side's 256 figure tiles (the donor's own copies there are dropped
//! from the copy queue, [`drain`]) and in 48 free effect tiles; the
//! palettes in the side's four OBJ palettes (the last two lightened, as AW2
//! does for a figure's flash) and in OBJ palettes 12 and 13 (effects).
//!
//! **Acting.** The donor figure's record (`0x02029A10`, per side 0xB4, five
//! figures of 0x24: `+0` state, `+4/+6` home, `+8/+A` position) is moved
//! to the unit's own place, so the enemy's shells land on it; the slide-in
//! and hit shakes still move it. When the side starts firing (`0x020296B0 +
//! 0x28 * side + 0x18` counts its shots), the weapon layer plays its whole
//! firing script, a volley: at each shot event a muzzle flash at the next
//! of the unit's points and a projectile (flying at the enemy's figures and
//! hitting one), or, for a direct shot, a hit on one (a Piperunner fires
//! record 29's shells at ground and sea targets and its own record's at
//! planes and copters, as Dual Strike does). A side fires one
//! volley a battle, timed from the donor's shot so that its last hit lands
//! as the donor's own shot would ([`UnitSpec::wait`]): then AW2 starts the
//! HP drain and the enemy's figures fall; should the drain start before all
//! hits have landed, it holds where the hits so far take it ([`hp_drain`]).
//! When the figure is destroyed its layers blink and its own blasts go off.
//!
//! **Struck.** An AW2 enemy's hits on the unit are Dual Strike's: at each of
//! its figure hits on the side (`0x020298E0 + 0x90 * side + 0x16`) the
//! enemy's own Dual Strike hit effect (its record's hit, by weapon, or its
//! indirect blast) where AW2's landed, and a few over the unit when an
//! indirect or area shot lands; AW2's own hit sprites on the unit are dropped.
//! A shot with no hit of its own (a missile, a shell) bursts on a plane or
//! copter with the target's own blast, as in Dual Strike ([`hit_on`]).
//! Dual Strike draws a hidden Stealth as usual in a battle, and so does this.
//!
//! Everything is worked out from emulated memory, and the animation state
//! lives in EWRAM ([`STATE`], [`FX`]), so rollback and both netplay peers
//! agree. With the pack off nothing here writes anything.
