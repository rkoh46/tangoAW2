//! The Volcano's colours in battle. The game loads them into sprite
//! palette 12 (`0x0803FE0A`), which is also the fourth army's buildings'
//! palette: no campaign map has both, but a Versus map with a Volcano and
//! Yellow Comet drew Yellow Comet's HQ, cities and bases in the Volcano's
//! colours. In Versus the Volcano gets sprite palette 2 instead, which the
//! battle map neither uses nor loads (5 is the day banner's).
//!
//! In the DS Campaign (Ring of Fire) the Volcano takes Dual Strike's colours,
//! read from the pack: Dual Strike's map sprites' palette file `bmap/00e`,
//! sub-palette 13 (its Volcano's, drawn at `bmap/015` +0x4700). Dual Strike's
//! palette is AW2's own with its greens made yellow-green (indices 1..5, the
//! lava, are the same), so it colours AW2's Volcano index for index. AW2's
//! maps keep AW2's colours.
