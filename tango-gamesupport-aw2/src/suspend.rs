//! tangoAW2's own battle state in a suspended game (the map menu's Save),
//! with the Dual Strike pack.
//!
//! AW2 saves a game in progress (`sub_08016D30`) as the 0xE28-byte block
//! `CaptureBattleSaveState` (`sub_08016F38`) fills at 0x02000000: day,
//! army, gPlaySt, the weather block, players, units, changed tiles,
//! inventions, up to +0xDAC. The rest of the block is written to Flash but
//! never read back (`sub_08017208`). State tangoAW2 keeps in its own RAM
//! and that lasts past a turn rides there, after a mark:
//!
//! - the Rules' fog flag while rain forces fog on ([`crate::ds_weather`]):
//!   gPlaySt is saved with the forced fog, and a game continued in rain
//!   kept fog on for good once the rain stopped;
//! - Ex Machina's stun ([`crate::co_powers`]): the units it marked were all
//!   free after Continue.
//!
//! (The sandstorm and the map's look are in the weather block, which AW2
//! saves itself; Com Towers are counted on the map.) Without the pack
//! nothing is written: the block is AW2's own, byte for byte.
//!
//! **A DS Campaign mission saved halfway** (Dual Strike's campaign has the
//! map menu's Save: "Save over Mission / Day data"). AW2 saves a campaign
//! mission in slot 2 and marks it in the profile (`0x0200C429`), and AW2
//! CAMPAIGN's Continue resumes it; a DS mission goes to its own slot,
//! [`DS_SLOT`], instead, so AW2's saved mission and its mark are left alone:
//! `sub_08016D30` is trapped at its start (in a session, slot 2: the mark
//! as it is noted) and at its call of the slot writer (the slot made
//! [`DS_SLOT`] and the mark put back, before the writer serializes the
//! profile). The block's tail also gets the session's own state after
//! [`DS_MARK`]: the mission, its flags ([`crate::ds_campaign`]'s 0x20..0x9F),
//! the countdown of Dual Strike's op 0x5A, Means to an End's state (the
//! Hard choice is the flags' 0x60, the records are in the DS record). DS CAMPAIGN's Continue resumes
//! the mission when [`DS_SLOT`] is in AW2's sector directory (the session
//! set up as for the world map, then AW2's own resume, `sub_08017688`); the
//! slot is dropped from the directory (AW2's delete, `sub_0801ABF8`, without
//! its write: the next save writes it) when the mission ends and on a new
//! DS Campaign.
