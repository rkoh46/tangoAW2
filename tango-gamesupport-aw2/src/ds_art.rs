//! The Black Crystal's and Black Obelisk's pictures, imported once from the
//! player's own Advance Wars: Dual Strike ROM.
//!
//! tangoAW2 ships none of Dual Strike's art. When a Dual Strike ROM (.nds,
//! game code AWRE) is in the ROMs folder, the library scan offers it here
//! ([`offer`]) and the two map sprites are read from it: file `bmap/015` of
//! the DS file system, LZ77-compressed, holds 4bpp bitmaps (rows of pixels,
//! low nibble first) of the Crystal (16x32 at 0x1600) and the Obelisk
//! (64x64 at 0x3F00, its 3x3 footprint at x 8..56, y 0..48). They are drawn
//! with sub-palette 12 of `bmap/00e`, Dual Strike's version of Black Hole's
//! palette; each colour is mapped to the nearest of Advance Wars 2's
//! (`0x080D3E84`, which the sprites are shown with). The scan then saves
//! them next to the ROMs ([`CACHE_NAME`], [`cache`]) and offers that file
//! on later scans, so the .nds is needed only once.
//!
//! Without them the Crystal and Obelisk are drawn with Advance Wars 2's own
//! minicannon and Black Cannon sprites ([`crate::obelisk`]). The sprite
//! layout is the same either way, so netplay peers run the same code
//! whatever art each has.
//!
//! `TANGOAW2_DS_ROM=<file>` (a DS ROM or a saved import) points the scripts
//! and tests at the art.
