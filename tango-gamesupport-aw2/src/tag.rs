//! CO tag pairs: Dual Strike's tag battles in AW2's battle engine, with the
//! Dual Strike pack (docs/AW2.md "CO tag pairs").
//!
//! **Dual Strike, as found** (USA ROM; arm9 addresses). A player's two COs
//! are two words at player +0x6C (the active CO, "slot 0") and +0x70 (the
//! partner, "slot 1"): bits 0..6 the CO, 10..11 its power, 14..17 the
//! powers it has used, 21..31 its meter. Everything the game works out for
//! an army (day-to-day, powers, skills) reads slot 0: only the active CO's
//! abilities apply.
//! - **Change** (map menu, `0x020BD628` -> `0x020DD6BC`): the active CO's
//!   power ends (`0x020E2CE0`), the two words (and the COs' skill blocks)
//!   are swapped (`0x020E19B4`), the partner's tag-in quote and the CO★SWAP
//!   animation play, and the turn ends (`0x020DDB38`). It is offered while
//!   the army has a partner (player +0x70) and no Tag Power is under way.
//! - **Meters**: one per CO, each with its own power count (the star cost
//!   grows with its own uses). A battle's charge (`0x020DCA..`) goes to the
//!   active CO in full and to the partner at half (`asr #1` of the active
//!   CO's amount, then the partner's own Star Power skill); nothing charges
//!   while a power is on (`0x020E2E10`).
//! - **Tag Power** (`0x020BD740` -> `0x020DD404`): offered when both COs
//!   can use their Super CO Power (`0x020E2AC8`); the active CO's Super
//!   Power starts and player +0x25 becomes 1. End is then hidden (its test
//!   `0x020BED58`) and Change reads "Switch COs and move again." (the second
//!   Change entry, `0x020BFAB8`): the first CO's power ends, the COs swap,
//!   +0x25 becomes 2, every unit of the army may move again (`0x020C6F98`)
//!   and the partner's Super Power starts (`0x020DD3C0`). +0x25 goes back to
//!   0 at the army's next turn start (`0x020C1950`).
//! - **Compatibility**: while +0x25 is 1 or 2 the army's firepower gets
//!   (compatibility - 100)% (`0x020E5C40` -> `0x020E5508`); the
//!   compatibility of a pair is a byte at CO record +0x84 + partner
//!   (`0x020E1928`, 65..130). Defence gets nothing (its callers pass 0).
//!   Pairs with a name for their Tag Power ("Power Wrench") are listed at
//!   record +0x6C (`0x020E17F0`); the others' is "Dual Strike".
//! - **The computer** (`0x020995C4` at its turn start): Tag Power when both
//!   COs can; with only the active CO ready it holds its Super Power while
//!   the partner's meter is high, and it leaves the CO Power to a partner
//!   ready for its Super Power. At its turn's end (`0x02099F88`): during a
//!   Tag Power it always Changes (the second half); otherwise it Changes
//!   (`0x02099BA0`, with CO abilities on) when the active CO's meter is
//!   nearer full than the partner's (the emptier one charges at full rate),
//!   or, the two alike, to the CO it rates higher (`0x02099DAC`).
//! - **EXP**: both COs of a pair get the battle's EXP (`0x020E9C24`, the
//!   loop over both slots).
//!
//! **Here.** The partner of army a (1..5) is [`STATE`] + [`REC`] * (a - 1):
//! its CO, its meter, its power count and announcement byte (player +0x20,
//! +0x25, +0x24) and its skills; [`swap`] exchanges them with the player
//! block's. The map menu (`OpenMapMenu`'s table, pool word
//! [`MENU_POOL`]) is a copy with Tag and Change while a battle has pairs;
//! their tests and actions are stubs to [`LANDING`], dead code that is
//! trapped. Everything lives in emulated RAM (both netplay peers and every
//! replay see the same).
