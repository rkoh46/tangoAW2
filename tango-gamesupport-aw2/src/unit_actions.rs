//!   [`crate::roster::chart`]); 8 fuel a day while hidden.
//! - Carrier: its air cargo is resupplied at each turn start, as the
//!   Cruiser's copters are.
//! - Black Boat: Repair, the APC's Supply command: every adjacent unit of
//!   its army is resupplied and repaired by 1 HP, paid at a tenth of the
//!   unit's price per HP. It does not supply at turn start as the APC does.
//! - Black Bomb: Explode (in the silo's Launch slot): every unit within 3 spaces (either

//!   destroyed (the game's own destruction, with its explosion).
//! - Oozium: it eats ([`crate::oozium`]).
//! - Stealth's and Black Boat's commands carry their own names.
