//! The CPU uses the new units' abilities, with the Dual Strike pack.
//!
//! AW2's CPU moves units by role and knows Attack, Capture, Load, Supply
//! (the APC's, at turn start) and Launch at a silo; it has no idea of
//! Hide, Explode or a Black Boat's Repair. These are decided here, from the
//! game state in RAM, at the edges of a CPU army's turn (the same on both
//! netplay peers and in replays):
//!
//! - Black Bomb, when the CPU starts moving its units: it flies (within its
//!   move and fuel, to an empty square) to where exploding does the most
//!   harm and explodes if that harm, in funds, is at least
//!   [`BOMB_WORTH`] and at least twice its own side's; otherwise it flies
//!   towards the nearest enemy. The explosion is the player's Explode
//!   ([`crate::unit_actions::blast`]) and the game's own destruction.
//! - Stealth, as the CPU's turn ends: it hides when enemies that could hit
//!   it are near and none of them can hit a hidden Stealth (Fighters,
//!   Stealths), while it has fuel for it; a hidden Stealth appears when its
//!   fuel runs low (a hidden one burns 8 a day).
//! - Oozium, when the CPU starts moving its units: one next to units it
//!   eats moves onto the most valuable and eats it ([`crate::oozium`]).
//! - Black Boat, as the CPU's turn ends: it repairs its army's adjacent
//!   units, as the player's Repair does.
//! - Buying: the CPU buys Megatanks, Stealths, Black Bombs and Black Boats
//!   by their rows ([`crate::unit_actions`]); Carriers, Oozium and
//!   Piperunners (past AW2's 24 types) in place of a Cruiser, a Md Tank or
//!   an Artillery / Rockets now and then ([`buy`]).
