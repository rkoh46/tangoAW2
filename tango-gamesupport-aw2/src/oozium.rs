//! The Oozium eats, with the Dual Strike pack: it has no weapon (no Fire,
//! no counter-attack); its move takes in the squares next to it that hold
//! a unit of another team (any unit, air and naval included, on a square
//! the Oozium can enter), and moving onto one destroys that unit with the
//! game's own destruction (its explosion on the map, no battle scene).
//!
//! - The move range: AW2's flood fill (`sub_0801F4B4`, one step each in
//!   `sub_0801F6F0`) stops at a square holding a unit of an army the mover's
//!   blocks. For a human army's Oozium ([`flood_start`]) such a square is
//!   let in ([`block_test`]) and nothing is reached through it; the move
//!   may end there ([`may_end`]).
//! - The command menu there shows Wait (the game hides it on an occupied
//!   square: [`wait_hide`]); Wait ends the move as usual, then the eat
//!   ([`wait_selected`]).
//! - The eat ([`eat_next`]): both power meters charge as for a battle in
//!   which the victim lost all its HP (`sub_080440E0`, the value from
//!   `GetCoPriceMultiplier`), the eater's army counts a unit destroyed
//!   (`sub_08026588`'s counters), then the game's destruction
//!   (`sub_0804018C`: camera, explosion, removal, units lost, and the
//!   unit planes rebuilt from the records, which leaves the Oozium alone
//!   on its square). Rout follows as after any destruction.
//! - A hidden unit (fog, a hidden Stealth) on the square the Oozium moves
//!   onto is eaten too: the move's walk (`sub_0802E7C8`, which stops at a unit) lets
//!   an Oozium onto its last square ([`trap_check`]).
//! - The CPU ([`cpu_eats`], when its turn starts, from
//!   [`crate::cpu_tactics`]): each of its Ooziums next to units it can eat
//!   eats the most valuable one (bars x price); the move and the eat are
//!   played from the frame's effects pass ([`effects_pass`]), before the
//!   CPU's other units act. One with nothing to eat moves a square towards
//!   the nearest enemy ([`advance`]: AW2's CPU, finding no weapon, would
//!   leave it standing).
//! - Immunity ([`immune`]), as in Dual Strike (its CO stat functions return
//!   0 for the Oozium's class, 6, and its CO blocks' unit filters leave it
//!   out): no CO stats ([`crate::co_roster`], not even a power's +10
//!   defence), no power's damage, stun or fuel loss, repair, move again or
//!   resupply, no Missile Silo or Black Bomb damage ([`SKIPS`],
//!   [`LEAVE_OUT`], [`crate::co_powers`]); the CPU's silo and strike
//!   scoring leave it out.
//!
//! Everything is decided from emulated RAM, the same on both netplay peers
//! and in replays; without the pack no trap does anything.
