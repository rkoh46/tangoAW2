//! Intel > General: Dual Strike's ally posture, on two fronts (docs/AW2.md
//! "Two fronts", "General").
//!
//! In Dual Strike's two-front missions the main front's Intel menu has a
//! "General" item (bank 0xC0 texts 98..101, the AI icon): one of four
//! postures, Strike ("Set ally to aggressive posture."), Assault
//! ("offensive"), General ("general, all-purpose") and Defense
//! ("defensive"), shown one at a time; A turns it to the next (General,
//! Defense, Strike, Assault). It is a byte of the army's player record
//! (+0x2E) that Dual Strike's CPU reads on each of its turns. Here it is a
//! posture per army in [`crate::two_front`]'s state; this module gives its
//! labels, help lines and icon (from the .nds), and its effect on AW2's
//! CPU:
//!
//! AW2's CPU gives each unit a role (its unit record's +0x0B: the
//! deployment's AI byte, or what the CPU's production gives a unit it
//! buys), and after its attack check moves the unit by that role
//! (`AiRunRoleMove`, `0x0805F4CC`, through the table at `0x085768E0`).
//! While an army has a posture other than General, its units are moved by
//! the role that matches it instead of their own:
//!
//! - Strike: 4, toward the nearest enemy units (and into them, whatever the
//!   odds: Dual Strike's Strike does not mark down a trade that costs it).
//! - Assault: 3, onto the enemy's properties, each unit given its own
//!   (Dual Strike's Assault pushes every advance to the top of its range).
//! - General: the units' own roles (Dual Strike's: its ranges at random).
//! - Defense: 0, where it stands (Dual Strike's Defense skips its advance
//!   steps); a unit still fires at what comes into its reach.
//!
//! Everything the posture changes is decided from emulated RAM (the
//! posture, the current army), so it is the same on both netplay peers
//! and in replays.
