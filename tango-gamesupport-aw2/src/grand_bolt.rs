//! Means to an End's Grand Bolt, as Dual Strike draws it, with the Dual
//! Strike pack.
//!
//! - Dual Strike draws its battle map in 3D, each cell a 16x16 texture. Its
//!   map stores the Grand Bolt as a picture (cell `(x, y)` holds `8 + 0x20 *
//!   y + x`), which only Means to an End (map 0xF8) reads through its own
//!   table (arm9 `0x02157F84`; every other map `0x02157BC4`): per terrain
//!   id a texture number and two flips (0x4000 left-right, 0x8000
//!   top-bottom). The Grand Bolt is one quarter drawn four times, textures
//!   0x78..0xA7, 16x16 at 4 bits a pixel, laid out one after another in
//!   `bmap/024` (`025`, `026` are the same with other edges, the textures
//!   Dual Strike loads for its other looks' borders), coloured by its
//!   terrain palette 2 (its cells' class, 0x1B, picks palette 2 from the
//!   table at arm9 `0x02157AE4`), from Means to an End's palette file
//!   `bmap/00b` (+0x40): the greys, the core's pinks and the sand, as Dual
//!   Strike's screen shows them (read back from its texture palettes in
//!   melonDS).
//! - Here: its cells are AW2's underlay (a structure's footprint: no unit
//!   enters), drawn by [`crate::wasteland`]'s painter with the Grand Bolt's
//!   own tiles (one per texture quadrant, mirrored with the tilemap's flips),
//!   put in the look's pool of free tiles as its composites are, then in
//!   static terrain tiles no other cell of the map draws with (one already
//!   there is used again), in BG palette 7 (the fogged copy of palette 3:
//!   Means to an End has no fog), set every frame of the mission
//!   ([`tick`]). The texture's ground around the dome (its sand colours
//!   7..11 and dots 12) takes the colours of the map's own plain as it is
//!   drawn now (weather included).
//! - Its three weak points (Dual Strike's parts 0xB..0xD at
//!   [`GRAND_BOLT_WEAK_POINTS`]) are AW2 inventions (a minicannon on tile
//!   [`PART_TILE`], crate::obelisk: no sprite, no fire, no heal, "G Bolt" in
//!   the terrain panel), drawn by the picture (its discs). A weak point
//!   whose Black Crystal stands is closed: it is no target, and anything
//!   else that hits it (a power) is undone ([`tick`]).
