//! Five armies: Orange Star, Blue Moon, Green Earth, Yellow Comet and Black
//! Hole on one Versus map.
//!
//! Advance Wars 2 has room for four armies: unit ids are one byte with the
//! army in the top two bits, the player table has four slots, turns wrap
//! after army 4, and so on. tangoAW2 gives army a the unit ids
//! (a-1)*51 + 1..50, moves the player table to free RAM with a fifth slot and
//! rewrites every place the game counts to four (`five/patches.txt`, checked
//! against the ROM by `five/gen.py`). The patches go into the ROM image in
//! memory only while the 5-army map is being played, and come out again
//! otherwise, so every other game runs the game's own code. Everything runs
//! inside the emulated frame, the same on both netplay peers.
