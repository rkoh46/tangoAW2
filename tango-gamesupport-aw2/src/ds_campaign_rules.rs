//! Dual Strike's campaign conditions and actions, in Rust: what Dual
//! Strike's scripts call (its own code, in overlay 1 and the ARM9 image) is
//! reached through magic stubs ([`crate::ds_campaign_data::Magic`]) and runs
//! here, on AW2's state.
//!
//! Dual Strike's battle state is AW2's grown: its units are AW2's records
//! (army base + 1..50, type at +0, flags at +1 with bit 0 "has moved",
//! fuel in 7 bits), its map keeps AW2's terrain classes (kind | owner << 5,
//! through a row-offset table), its structures AW2's inventions list
//! (8 bytes: x, y, kind in bits 6..9 of the halfword at +2, HP at +4). So
//! each of Dual Strike's 40 or so mission conditions reads the same thing
//! on AW2's state here ([`predicate`], one entry per Dual Strike function,
//! as read from its code).
