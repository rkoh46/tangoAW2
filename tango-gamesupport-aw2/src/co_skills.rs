//! Dual Strike's CO skills (docs/AW2.md "CO skills"): the skills each army
//! has on in a battle, and what they do.
//!
//! Dual Strike's 43 player skills are ids 0x20..0x4A in its skill table
//! (overlay 0 `0x022F5ECC`: rank, name, description); its three tag skills
//! (0x35..0x37) need tag pairs and are left out. Each army's skills in the
//! battle being played are a bitmap in [`ACTIVE`] (bit `id - 0x20`), set when
//! the battle starts from the mode's rules (the DS Campaign, Survival and the
//! War Room as Dual Strike has them, AW2's campaign, Versus with its Skills
//! rule); everything here reads only that bitmap, so a battle with no skills
//! on (the default everywhere AW2 has no skills) plays as it always did.
//!
//! The effects, as Dual Strike's code has them (its functions in brackets):
//! - attack (`0x020E646C`, `0x020E68D0`, `0x020E6AE4`): Bruiser/Brawler +5/+8
//!   for direct units, Sharpshooter/Sniper +5/+8 for indirect ones; Road
//!   Rage, Ranger, Urban Fighter, Mountaineer, Seamanship +10 on road, wood,
//!   city, mountain, sea; Backstab +15 for a dived Sub or hidden Stealth;
//!   High and Dry, Icebreaker, Sand Scorpion +20 in rain, snow, sandstorm.
//! - defence (`0x020E61D8`, `0x020E63B0`): Slam Guard/Shield +8/+12 against
//!   direct attacks, Snipe Guard/Shield +8/+12 against indirect ones, APC
//!   Guard +10 for transports.
//! - funds and repairs: Gold Rush +100 a day per property that earns
//!   (`0x020E0158`); Mechanic/Gear Head repair 1/2 HP more (`0x020E5EC4`);
//!   Combat Pay, 2% of the value of the HP its attacks take (`0x020C86CC`).
//! - Missile Guard: a silo's blast (and Victory or Death!'s Black Arc) takes
//!   10 HP points less (`0x020E6874`).
//!
//! Everything lives in emulated RAM, the same on both netplay peers.
