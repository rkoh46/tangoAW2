//! Dual Strike's Com Tower, with the Dual Strike pack, in Versus.
//!
//! Every unit of the army that owns a Com Tower fires 10% harder per tower
//! it owns (its CO's own figure: Javier's is higher, and his units defend
//! better too, [`crate::co_roster`]); a neutral tower does nothing until it is captured. Towers earn
//! no funds, and capturing one never ends the battle (a Lab's would).
//!
//! AW2 has no free terrain code, but it has the Lab (0x14): a property that
//! is captured, counted per army (`gPlayers[a].labs`, +0x10) and has owner
//! tiles, and which only the campaign uses (capturing one does not end a
//! Versus battle). In Versus with the pack a Lab is a Com Tower: it gets
//! Dual Strike's tower picture (from the pack, `bmap/015` cell 8, drawn in
//! AW2's building colours), the name "Tower", and the firepower. In the
//! campaign, or without the pack, a Lab is a Lab.
//!
//! The picture goes in the building sheet's Lab tiles, except in a
//! five-army game, where those hold Black Hole's HQ ([`crate::five`]): there
//! the tower is drawn from the Crystal's tiles (or, with a Crystal on the
//! map, the Obelisk's; with both, it keeps the Lab's picture).
