"""Build tangoAW2's 5-army Versus maps (five/maps.txt) into
src/five_map_data.rs.

Usage: map.py <rom.gba>   (the ROM is read for the game's sea-edge table, and
its own maps, which every tile is then checked against: five/tilecheck.py)

Each map in maps.txt is a `map NAME` line, an `armies N TAB COLOURS...` line
(N armies, the Versus tab 3 Vs. / 5 3P / 6 4P / 9 5P, and each army's
starting colour: 1 Orange Star .. 5 Black Hole), `units ARMY TYPE...` lines,
then its rows, one character per tile:
  ~ sea   r reef   . plain   f wood   ^ mountain
  R road (straights, bends, junctions)   I pipe   Z pipe seam (in a straight
          run, which may end at a base: B Z I I ...)
  - river   = bridge (over a river or the sea; roads join it)   , shoal
  t T     Com Tower (the Lab, crate::com_tower): neutral, or the army whose
          HQ is nearest
  1..5    the HQ of army 1..5 (Orange Star, Blue Moon, Green Earth,
          Yellow Comet, Black Hole)
  B C A P base, city, airport, port of the army whose HQ is nearest
  Q       a second HQ of the army whose HQ is nearest (the BH Campaign's Rail Yard)
  b c a p neutral base, city, airport, port
  Black Hole's inventions (theirs by the game's rules), each at its anchor,
  with # over the rest of its footprint:
  S N W E minicannon facing down / up / left / right
  L laser   v n Black Cannon facing down / up (3x3)
  F Black Factory (3x4, anchor on the third row)
  V Volcano (4x4, anchor second column, third row)
  D Deathray (3x3)
  M       missile silo (one tile; a foot soldier on it launches; the BH
          Campaign's reversed Black Onyx uses the four in the corners)
  X O     Black Crystal (1 tile) and Black Obelisk (3x3), tangoAW2's healing
          structures (obelisk.rs); they belong to the Black Hole army
A `look wasteland` line draws the map in Dual Strike's Wasteland colours
(crate::wasteland); such a map is listed only with the Dual Strike pack on (as is one with
`look pack`: normal colours, pack only).
Unit types: 1 Infantry, 2 Mech, 3 Md Tank, 5 Tank, 6 Recon, 7 APC,
8 Neotank, 10 Artillery, 11 Rockets, 14 Anti-Air, 15 Missiles, 16 Fighter,
17 Bomber, 19 Battle Copter, 20 Transport Copter, 21 Battleship, 22 Cruiser,
23 Lander, 24 Submarine. Ships start in the sea next to the army's ports,
aircraft next to its airports, Piperunners (9) on its nearest pipe, the rest
nearest its HQ.
